# SCHOOL APP

Hi! I'm Pablo Acosta and this is my code for Rather Labs' tech challenge.

The app is deployed to https://room-manager-school-app.netlify.app/ so you can try it out.

To get it working I built a little backend deployed to https://school-app-back.onrender.com.
I built the database using MongoDB Atlas, the Mongo Data API for Atlas and MongoDB Compass.
You can check the rooms saved in the db in: https://school-app-back.onrender.com/rooms
You can check the students saved in the db in: https://school-app-back.onrender.com/students
You can find the backend repo here: https://github.com/pablojacosta/school-app-back

I made a little video showing the app working: https://recordit.co/J4Pr9OKbmm

As the app is deployed and working, you won't need the used environment variables, but I'll show you images of those variables on Netlify and OnRender:
On the frontend I only added the backend url as an env variable:

On the backend I added all the MongoDb database variables:

Please, take into account that OnRender's servers "sleep" when they are not being used, so the first time you check the app, the first request to the server will take a little bit of time, but then it will work
as expected.

I hope you like my code :D.

Thank you very much for this opportunity!
