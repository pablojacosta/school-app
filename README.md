# SCHOOL APP

The app is deployed to https://room-manager-school-app.netlify.app/ so you can try it out.

To get it working I built a little backend deployed to https://school-app-back.onrender.com.
I built the database using MongoDB Atlas, the Mongo Data API for Atlas and MongoDB Compass.
You can check the rooms saved in the db in: https://school-app-back.onrender.com/rooms
You can check the students saved in the db in: https://school-app-back.onrender.com/students
You can find the backend repo here: https://github.com/pablojacosta/school-app-back

Please, take into account that OnRender's servers "sleep" when they are not being used, so the first time you check the app, the first request to the server will take a little bit of time, but then it will work
as expected.
